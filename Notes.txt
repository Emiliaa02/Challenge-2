- README is clear

- you should not leave part of the tests commented in the code.
    Put the two tests in separate files in a test foalder instead.
- the user should not have to uncomment lines in your code or add libraries, for instance in MatrixTraits.hpp, in order to use complex numbers.
    This is the reason why you use a template for the type T.

- the operations that are not allowed in compressed form should print a warning when called in this case.
- instead of defining two types of maps for the row and column wise storage you could define a comparison operator that works differently according to the case.

- friend operator should be defined outside of the class.

- const call operator does not work.
